The basic concept of my logo is something similar to rayban website, The name with the logo is just an idea I came up with and it can be changed later on.

Using the pen tool on Figma was a little harder than I expected, mainly because I kept forgetting I had to click and hold to be able to get the line to curve and at times I would hold on too long and it would get messed up.

Once I had it made the rest was pretty simple other than formatting the SVG code, it wouldn't format despite all the extensions I downloaded but I eventually got it to format which made it easier to work with.
